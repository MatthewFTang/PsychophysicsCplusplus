# Psychophysics  experiments in C++

### A small project implementing a psychophysics experiment in C++ using the raylib library.

I made this project to determine whether modern c++ graphics libraries can be easily used to program psychophysics
or psychology experiments. PsychToolbox  (https://psychtoolbox.org/) in MATLAB and PsychPy  (https://www.psychopy.org/)
in Python are the most-widely used platforms for making experiments for psychophysics.

## Requirements

<ul>
<li>C++ 20
<li> raylib (https://www.raylib.com, https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) 
<li> Dear ImGui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
<li> fmt (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
</ul>
